                <h2>2. When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</h2>
                <p>Ans: Node.js is an open source server environment which uses JavaScript on the server to develop backend applications. </p>
                <p>Mainly there are two types of database management systems (DBMS): Relational and NoSQL DBMS.</p>
                <p>Relational DBMS manages the databases that store data in a structured format, using rows and columns</p>
                <p>NoSQL DBMS manages the database that stores unstructured data in forms of collections and documents</p>
                <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL DBMS, usually people prefer mongoDB for following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NoSQL Database Management Systems are more flexible than RDBMS</li>
                    <li>The expense of maintaining and even setting up a RDBMS is relatively high</li>
                    <li>MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data</li>
                    <li>It holds a set of collections and stores data as document</li>
                    <li>Can handle variety of data and huge amount of data</li>
                    <li>It offers a MongoDB Node.js Driver which provides a JavaScript API and implements the network protocol required to read and write from a local or remote MongoDB database</li>
                    <li>All you have to do is install NPM -mongodb package in your Application Code</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h2>
                <p>Ans: JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. </p>
                <p>JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>

                <p>A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.</p>
